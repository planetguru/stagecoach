Introduction
------------

Stagecoach is the first part of a project to create open-source music
in the form of a text-based musical notation which can be patched,
extended, modified, re-arranged and then re-committed back to the 
original music project - just like a piece of open source software.

The coding system used is lilypond (see <http://lilypond.org>.)

The files provided within this project include:

stagecoach.ly - the lilypond source file
stagecoach.pdf - a pdf of the engraved piano score
stagecoach.midi - a midi file generated by lilypond itself


How to use it
-------------

Your options are simple. You can either:

1. Print off the pdf, sit at the piano and play it, OR
2. Modify the stagecoach.ly source code to add your own variations
of the original musical score, recompile and GOTO 1.

You might want to add a new part, or an extra voicing. Perhaps you 
have an idea for some variations on the theme, or maybe you just
want to add some tweaks to the score to reflect an improvement. It's
totally up to you.
